# TicTacToeMCTS
A Unity WebGL project for a TicTacToe game, using [Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search) for its AI decision making.

The MCTS decision making is implemented in [TreeNode class](https://github.com/aldidoanta/TicTacToeMCTS/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/MCTS/TreeNode.cs), based on [Simon Lucas' implementation of MCTS](https://web.archive.org/web/20151213012727/http://mcts.ai/code/java.html).
